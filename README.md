# Preprocessor Directives

 * What is a Preprocessor?
   
The C++ preprocessor is a program that processes your source code before the compiler sees it.

 * What does it do?

The C++ pre-processor first strips all the comments from the source file
and replaces each comment with a single space.
Then it looks for pre-processor directives and executes them.

 * Diretives Start with a " # "
   
Pre-processor directors are lines in the source code that begin with a pound or hashtag symbol.

 * Commands to preprocessors.

_ Examples.
* #include <iostream>

* #include "myfile.h"

* if

* elif

* else

* endif
